      "content": "When birds fly near windows, they face the risk of window collisions, which can result in injury or even death. Birds often collide with windows because they don't recognize the window as a solid surface. The reflection of the sky, trees, or other natural elements in the glass may confuse them, leading them to think that they are flying towards open space.\n\nWindow collisions are a significant threat to bird populations. According to some estimates, hundreds of millions of birds die each year due to window collisions in the United States alone.\n\nTo protect birds and prevent collisions, homeowners can take several measures, such as:\n1. Making windows more visible: Applying decals, stickers, or patterns on the glass or using window films can help break up reflections and make windows more visible to birds.\n2. Installing bird-friendly glass: This type of glass reduces reflections and is more visible to birds, reducing the likelihood of collisions.\n3. Reducing outdoor lighting: Bright lights can disorient birds at night, leading them towards windows. Turning off unnecessary outdoor lighting can help prevent collisions.\n4. Adding screens or nets outside windows: Installing screens or nets can provide a barrier that can cushion the impact if a bird flies into the window, preventing injury or death.\n5. Placing bird feeders close or far from windows: Positioning bird feeders either very close (within 3 feet) or far away (over 30 feet) from windows can reduce the chances of collisions since birds flying to or from the feeder will either be too close to gain enough speed for a fatal impact, or far enough away to recognize the window as a barrier.\n\nBy taking these steps, homeowners can help protect birds from the dangers posed by windows and support their local bird populations."

These stations are situated along a railway line and typically provide platforms that facilitate easy access to trains as they stop at the station.\n\nBoth train stations and railway stations serve a vital role in connecting different parts of a city, region, or country, enabling the efficient movement of people and goods. They often feature additional facilities like ticket offices, customer service kiosks, waiting areas, restrooms, and sometimes even shops, ensuring that passengers can obtain essential services and information during their journey.\n\nIn summary, the terms \"train station\" and \"railway station\" are interchangeable, with both referring to a location where trains stop for passengers and cargo to be loaded or unloaded. Stations are strategically positioned along rail lines and provide platforms and facilities to cater to the needs of travelers and the operations of the railway system."

      "content": "Yes, it is quite common for young bears, like other animal species, to explore and investigate their surroundings as a part of their natural behavioral development. Bear cubs are curious by nature and as they grow, they learn to navigate their environment and discover how to find food, interact with other bears, and avoid potential threats.\n\nDuring this exploratory phase, bear cubs may play with each other or with objects they encounter, which helps improve their physical skills, coordination, and socialization. Exploration and investigation of their surroundings also help build their cognitive abilities, as they discover how things work or how to manipulate objects in their environment. This learning process is an essential component of their development, ensuring that they acquire the necessary skills to survive and thrive in the wild as adults."

      "content": "Zebras and antelopes (including gazelles) typically inhabit grasslands, savannas, and plains in regions of Africa. These types of habitats offer a vast expanse of grasses and other vegetation for the animals to graze on, as well as providing some cover and protection from predators with the presence of scattered bushes and trees. \n\nGrasslands and savannas are characterized by a mix of grasses and occasional trees or shrubs, often found in areas with alternating climates that result in wet and dry seasons. These ecosystems support a diverse range of plant and animal species, with herbivores like zebras and antelopes playing an essential role in the food chain by grazing on the vegetation and serving as prey for carnivores such as lions, cheetahs, and hyenas. \n\nIn conclusion, zebras and antelopes are typically found in grasslands, savannas, and plains throughout Africa, where they contribute to a complex and diverse ecosystem as both consumers of vegetation and as prey for various predators. The image of zebras and antelopes grazing among the shrubs and bushes in the open field is consistent with their natural habitats and behaviors."

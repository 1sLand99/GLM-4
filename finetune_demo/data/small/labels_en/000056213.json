      "content": "The objective of a soccer game is for each team to score goals by getting the soccer ball into their opponent's net. Teams consist of 11 players each, including a goalkeeper, and the game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The team with the highest number of goals at the end of the match is declared the winner. \n\nSoccer, also known as football, is a highly popular sport played worldwide and governed by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). There are various professional leagues, regional tournaments, and international competitions, such as the FIFA World Cup, which is held every four years.\n\nThe sport comprises two halves, each lasting 45 minutes, and the clock continues to run throughout the game. If the match ends in a tie, depending on the competition or tournament rules, it may result in a draw, extra time, or penalty shootouts to determine the winner. \n\nSoccer requires a combination of physical fitness, technical skills, teamwork, and strategy. Players need to be aware of their positions, work cohesively with their teammates, and be able to make quick decisions in response to the dynamic and fluid nature of the game."

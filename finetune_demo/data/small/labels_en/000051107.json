      "content": "There are several common skateboarding tricks that could be performed in mid-air, including:\n\n1. Ollie: The Ollie is a fundamental skateboard trick that involves jumping into the air with the skateboard sticking to the skater's feet.\n\n2. Kickflip: In a kickflip, the skater jumps into the air and flips the skateboard 360 degrees along its axis, using only their feet. The skater then lands back on the skateboard after it completes the rotation.\n\n3. Heelflip: Similar to a kickflip, but the skateboard flips in the opposite direction. The skater uses their heel instead of their toe to flick the board, causing it to spin 360 degrees.\n\n4. 360 Flip (Treflip): This trick combines aspects of the kickflip and a 360-degree spin (called a \"shove-it\"). The skateboard spins 360 degrees while flipping, and the skater lands back on the board after the rotation.\n\n5. Grabs: A grab is a type of aerial trick where the skater grabs their skateboard with one or both hands while in mid-air. There are many variations of grabs, such as \"Indy grab,\" \"mute grab,\" and \"melon grab,\" among others.\n\nThese are just a few examples of skateboarding tricks that could be performed in mid-air. Skaters often invent and perform their own unique combinations of tricks, showcasing their creativity and skill."

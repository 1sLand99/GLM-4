Cats are curious by nature and may be attracted to new or unusual items in their environment, such as the assortment of food on the table. The cat's presence on the table may also indicate that it wants to eat, sniff, or inspect the food items. Alternatively, the cat might have chosen the table as a comfortable and elevated surface to rest or observe its surroundings from a higher vantage point."

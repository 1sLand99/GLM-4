      "content": "Based on the available information, it's difficult to definitively determine if the trains are for short or long-distance travel. However, since they are passenger trains, it is possible that they could be used for either short commuter routes or longer journeys connecting cities, depending on their design and configuration.\n\nShort-distance trains, also known as commuter or suburban trains, typically serve a metro area or a region and make more frequent stops, catering to daily commuters or regional travelers. Their interior configurations often prioritize seating capacity and standing room to accommodate a larger number of passengers during peak travel hours.\n\nLong-distance trains, on the other hand, are designed for intercity or inter-regional travel and feature more spacious and comfortable interiors. These trains usually have amenities like food and beverage services, restrooms, and sometimes sleeping quarters or private compartments for overnight journeys. Long-distance trains make fewer stops and travel at higher speeds to cover greater distances in less time.\n\nIn any case, both types of trains have the primary purpose of transporting passengers between various locations and serve as an essential mode of public transportation for many people."
